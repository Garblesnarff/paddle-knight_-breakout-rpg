# The Aetherium Nexus - World Plan

## Theme & Setting
**"The Aetherium Nexus"** - An ethereal realm of pure cosmic energy and starlight. Players ascend into a celestial void, battling entities formed from condensed nebulae and shattered constellations. The environment itself is alive with cosmic phenomena, altering ball trajectories and paddle movement.

### Thematic Evolution
- **World 1**: Physical combat (Knights, Soldiers) - Core mechanics
- **World 2**: Elemental magic (Fire, Ice, Lightning) - Adds elemental interactions
- **World 3**: Shadow/Corruption magic (Abyssal Depths) - Introduces debuffs and environmental hazards
- **World 4**: Techno-Organic Fusion (Bio-Forge Nexus) - Adaptive enemies and resource management
- **The Aetherium Nexus**: Cosmic Manipulation - Focuses on precision, trajectory alteration, and environmental physics.

## New Stat: Focus
- **Effect:** Increases precision (reduces paddle "dead zones" for more accurate bounces), extends duration of positive celestial effects (e.g., ball speed boosts), and slightly increases base ball speed.

## New Enemy Types

| Enemy | HP | Points | Special Ability |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stardust Mote** | 2 | 75 | Small, fast. **Fades in and out of visibility**, making it harder to track and hit. |
| **Nebula Cloud** | 4 | 90 | Stationary, translucent. **Reduces ball damage by 50%** while the ball is inside its area. |
| **Constellation Node** | 3 | 80 | When destroyed, **grants a temporary ball speed boost** (e.g., +20% for 3 seconds) to all active balls. |
| **Solar Flare** | 3 | 100 | Emits a blinding flash that **briefly reverses paddle horizontal controls** (left is right, right is left) for 2 seconds. |
| **Graviton Orb** | 5 | 110 | **Pulls nearby balls towards its center**, altering their trajectory and making precise shots difficult. |
| **Warp Crystal** | 4 | 120 | When hit, **teleports the ball to a random, unoccupied brick position** on the screen. |

## Unique Mechanics

### Environmental Hazards
- **Cosmic Drift**: Slow, continuous horizontal or vertical currents that **gently push balls and the paddle** across the screen, requiring constant adjustment.
- **Meteorite Impact**: Randomly, a small meteorite will **destroy a single brick** (or deal heavy damage to a boss brick) and leave a temporary, small debris field that slows balls by 20% for 1 second.
- **Singularity Vortex**: A rare, temporary vortex appears on the field, **pulling all active balls towards its center** for a few seconds before dissipating. If a ball enters the center, it is instantly destroyed.

### Advanced Enemy Interactions
- **Visibility Manipulation**: Enemies that become harder to see, forcing players to rely on sound or prediction.
- **Damage Reduction**: Bricks that absorb a portion of ball damage, requiring more hits.
- **Ball Buffs**: Destroying certain bricks provides temporary enhancements to the ball.
- **Control Reversal**: Enemies that temporarily flip player controls, testing adaptability.
- **Trajectory Alteration**: Bricks that actively change ball paths, demanding quick reactions.
- **Ball Teleportation**: Bricks that unpredictably move the ball, adding an element of chaos.

## Boss Fight: The Celestial Architect

### Phase 1 (100%-70% HP): Stellar Construction
- **Constellation Spawns**: Periodically spawns small clusters of "Constellation Node" bricks, which, when destroyed, provide ball speed boosts.
- **Orbital Defense**: Creates 2-3 small, indestructible "Orbital Barrier" bricks that slowly rotate around the boss, blocking direct ball paths.

### Phase 2 (70%-40% HP): Cosmic Alignment
- **Graviton Field**: Activates a temporary field that **increases the pull strength of all Graviton Orbs** on the screen, making ball control more challenging.
- **Warp Cascade**: When hit, the boss has a higher chance to **teleport the ball to a random location** on the screen.
- **Solar Burst**: Emits a flash that **reverses paddle controls** for a longer duration (e.g., 4 seconds).

### Phase 3 (40%-0% HP): Universal Collapse
- **Singularity Summon**: Summons a temporary "Singularity Vortex" on the field, threatening to destroy balls.
- **Meteorite Barrage**: Triggers a rapid succession of "Meteorite Impacts" across the brick field.
- **Cosmic Overload**: At low HP, the boss rapidly spawns all types of celestial bricks and continuously applies "Cosmic Drift" effects, creating a chaotic final challenge.

## Stage Progression

### Stage 1: "Stardust Nursery"
- **Focus**: Introduction to Stardust Motes (fading) and Nebula Clouds (damage reduction).
- **Layout**: Simple patterns to familiarize players with visibility and damage mechanics.
- **Star Criteria**: 180s completion, 70% HP minimum

### Stage 2: "Constellation Paths"
- **Focus**: Constellation Nodes (ball speed) and Solar Flares (control reversal).
- **Layout**: Designs that encourage strategic destruction of Constellation Nodes for speed boosts, while managing control reversals.
- **Star Criteria**: 200s completion, 65% HP minimum

### Stage 3: "Gravitational Anomalies"
- **Focus**: Graviton Orbs (trajectory alteration) and Warp Crystals (ball teleportation).
- **Layout**: Complex arrangements that test player's ability to adapt to unpredictable ball paths.
- **Star Criteria**: 220s completion, 65% HP minimum

### Stage 4: "Cosmic Storm"
- **Focus**: Combines all previous enemy types and introduces all environmental hazards (Cosmic Drift, Meteorite Impact, Singularity Vortex).
- **Layout**: Dynamic, challenging layouts that require constant awareness and quick reactions.
- **Star Criteria**: 240s completion, 60% HP minimum

### Stage 5: "The Architect's Domain"
- **Focus**: Epic final boss battle against The Celestial Architect, integrating all world mechanics.
- **Layout**: A central boss arena with supporting celestial enemies and environmental hazards throughout the fight.
- **Star Criteria**: 300s completion, 55% HP minimum

## Difficulty Scaling

### Enemy Stats Progression
- **HP Range**: 2-5 HP for regular bricks, boss significantly higher.
- **Point Values**: 75-120 points, reflecting increased complexity and challenge.
- **Complexity**: Enemies introduce mechanics that directly affect ball properties (damage, speed, position) and player control (paddle reversal, movement push).

### Challenge Progression
- **Time Limits**: Increasingly tight completion windows for stages.
- **HP Requirements**: More demanding survival thresholds, requiring effective use of defense and healing.
- **Mechanical Complexity**: Introduces mechanics that demand high precision, quick adaptation to changing ball physics, and management of temporary debuffs.
- **Environmental Challenges**: Dynamic hazards that directly alter ball and paddle movement, adding a layer of unpredictable physics to the game.

## Design Philosophy

This world aims to elevate the core brick-breaking experience by introducing mechanics that challenge player precision, adaptability, and spatial awareness. The celestial theme allows for visually distinct enemies and hazards that directly manipulate the fundamental physics of the game, making each stage a unique puzzle of trajectory and timing. It's about mastering the cosmic dance of balls and bricks.
