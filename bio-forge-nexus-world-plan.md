# The Bio-Forge Nexus - World Plan

## Theme & Setting
**"The Bio-Forge Nexus"** - A realm where ancient, resilient organic life has been violently fused with advanced, self-replicating machinery. This world presents a chaotic ecosystem of living metal, pulsating circuits, and rampant growth, challenging the player with adaptive enemies and environmental interference.

### Thematic Evolution
- **World 1**: Physical combat (Knights, Soldiers) - Basic breakout with RPG stats
- **World 2**: Elemental magic (Fire, Ice, Lightning) - Introduces magical mechanics
- **World 3**: Shadow/Corruption magic (Abyssal Depths) - Advanced mechanics with environmental hazards
- **The Bio-Forge Nexus**: Techno-Organic Fusion - Introduces adaptive enemies, debuffs, and environmental manipulation.

## New Enemy Types

| Enemy | HP | Points | Special Ability |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Gearsprite** | 3 | 85 | Small, fast. High chance to dodge ball on hit. |
| **Vine-Bot** | 4 | 95 | Stationary. Periodically extends organic tendrils that can temporarily trap balls (slows to 10% speed) or paddle (reduces speed by 50%). |
| **Scrap Golem** | 6 | 130 | High HP, armored. Explodes into 3 smaller Gearsprites on death. |
| **Corruptor** | 5 | 110 | Floats. Emits a pulse every 10 seconds that temporarily disables one of the player's active skills for 5 seconds. |
| **Hive Mind** | 7 | 160 | Stationary. Spawns a weak "Drone" brick every 5 seconds until destroyed. |
| **Replicator** | 4 | 100 | When hit, creates a copy of itself or an adjacent brick (if space allows). |

## Unique Mechanics

### Environmental Hazards
- **Overgrowth Zones**: Areas of the screen where organic matter grows, slowing ball speed by 30% and reducing paddle movement speed by 20% while inside.
- **Energy Surges**: Random, short-lived lines of electrical energy that traverse the screen, dealing minor damage to the paddle if touched.
- **Replication Fields**: Designated areas on the brick field where any brick (including player-spawned ones) can spontaneously replicate if left untouched for 15 seconds.

### Advanced Enemy Interactions
- **Self-Repair**: Certain enemies (e.g., Scrap Golem, Hive Mind) slowly regenerate 1 HP every 5 seconds if not continuously damaged.
- **Debuff Application**: Enemies that apply temporary negative effects to the player or balls.
- **Spawning/Replication**: Enemies that generate other enemies or copies of themselves.
- **Resource Conversion**: Destroyed enemies might drop unique "components" (a new type of pickup) that can be used for specific upgrades in the shop or skill tree.

## Boss Fight: The Prime Synthesizer

### Phase 1 (100%-70% HP): Adaptive Growth
- **Tendril Strike**: Extends organic tendrils from its core that sweep across the screen, dealing moderate damage to the paddle.
- **Drone Swarm**: Spawns 3-5 weak Drone bricks that move erratically and can be easily destroyed for minor points.
- **Self-Repair Protocol**: Regenerates 1 HP every 3 seconds if not actively damaged by a ball.

### Phase 2 (70%-40% HP): Technological Overload
- **Energy Beam**: Fires a concentrated laser beam that slowly tracks the paddle's movement for 3 seconds.
- **Corrupting Pulse**: Emits a wide pulse that temporarily disables one of the player's currently equipped active skills for 7 seconds.
- **Replication Cascade**: When hit, has a 25% chance to replicate an adjacent brick or spawn a Replicator enemy.

### Phase 3 (40%-0% HP): Symbiotic Collapse
- **Systemic Decay**: Random sections of the arena floor become "decay zones" that rapidly drain ball speed and paddle HP if entered.
- **Forced Evolution**: Transforms all remaining non-boss bricks into more powerful versions (e.g., Grunts become Tanks, Apprentices become Corruptors).
- **Final Gambit**: At 10% HP, initiates a "Meltdown" sequence. The boss becomes stationary and rapidly spawns all enemy types while firing continuous Energy Surges. Player must destroy the core before being overwhelmed.

## Stage Progression

### Stage 1: "The Rooted Machines"
- **Focus**: Introduction to Gearsprites (dodging) and Vine-Bots (trapping), with initial Overgrowth Zones.
- **Layout**: Simple patterns to familiarize players with new enemy behaviors and environmental slowdowns.
- **Star Criteria**: 180s completion, 70% HP minimum

### Stage 2: "Circuitous Gardens"
- **Focus**: Scrap Golems (explosive spawning) and more frequent Energy Surges.
- **Layout**: Designs that encourage strategic targeting to manage Golem explosions and avoid energy lines.
- **Star Criteria**: 200s completion, 65% HP minimum

### Stage 3: "The Corrupted Weave"
- **Focus**: Corruptors (skill disabling) and Hive Minds (spawning), with active Replication Fields.
- **Layout**: Complex arrangements that test player's ability to prioritize targets and manage debuffs.
- **Star Criteria**: 220s completion, 65% HP minimum

### Stage 4: "Synthetic Ecosystem"
- **Focus**: Combines all previous enemy types and hazards, emphasizing self-repair and rapid spawning.
- **Layout**: Dense, dynamic layouts that require constant movement and quick decision-making.
- **Star Criteria**: 240s completion, 60% HP minimum

### Stage 5: "The Prime Conduit"
- **Focus**: Epic final boss battle against The Prime Synthesizer, integrating all world mechanics.
- **Layout**: A central boss arena with supporting enemies and environmental hazards throughout the fight.
- **Star Criteria**: 300s completion, 55% HP minimum

## Difficulty Scaling

### Enemy Stats Progression
- **HP Range**: 3-7 HP for regular bricks (higher than previous worlds), boss significantly higher.
- **Point Values**: 85-160 points, reflecting increased complexity and challenge.
- **Complexity**: Most advanced enemy interactions including dodging, trapping, skill disabling, self-repair, and spawning.

### Challenge Progression
- **Time Limits**: Increasingly tight completion windows for stages.
- **HP Requirements**: More demanding survival thresholds, requiring effective use of defense and healing.
- **Mechanical Complexity**: Introduces enemies that directly interfere with player abilities and movement, demanding adaptive strategies.
- **Environmental Challenges**: Dynamic hazards that directly affect ball/paddle movement and skill usage, adding another layer of difficulty.

## Design Philosophy

This world is designed to push players beyond simple aiming and power, forcing them to engage with a constantly evolving battlefield. The fusion of organic resilience and mechanical precision creates enemies that adapt, regenerate, and interfere with player abilities. Mastery of this world will require strategic target prioritization, quick reactions to environmental threats, and intelligent management of skills and resources, preparing players for the ultimate test of their Paddle Knight skills.
